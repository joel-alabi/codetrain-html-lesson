 <div class="verse">1.In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  
  <p>2. And the earth was without form, and void;  and darkness was upon the face of the deep.   And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</p> 
  3 And God said, Let there be light:  and there was light.
    4 And God saw the light, that it was good:  and God divided the light from the darkness. the first day. 
  5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.   And the evening and the morning were   
  6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 
    7   And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:  and it was so. 
   <p>  8 And God called the firmament Heaven.   And the evening and the morning were the second day. </p>

<div class="2" id="newtestament">  24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind:  and it was so.   25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind:  and God saw that it was good.  </p>  

26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:  and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.   
 27 .So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him;  male and female created he them. 
 29.  And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed;  to you it shall be for meat. 
<p> 30. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat:  and it was so.   </p>

	1. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.   2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 
	  3 .And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;. 
	   
	       4. Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first:  and there Abram called on the name of the LORD. 
		5. And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.   6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together:  for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 
 7. And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle:  and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. 
  8. And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;  for we be brethren.   9 Is not the whole land before thee?  separate thyself, I pray thee, from me:  if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;  or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.   

<p>10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.   11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan;  and Lot journeyed east:  and they separated themselves the one from the other.   12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.   13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.   </p>
